# Wink Dashboard

### Configuring your Wink Dashboard

Open `js/config.js` and put in your Wink username/email and password. This is not required, as you will be prompted for login credentials if these are left blank.

```javascript
/* WINK CREDENTIALS */
var wink_username = "";
var wink_password = "";

/* USE WITH WEATHER */
var enable_weather = false;
var weather_path = "";
```

If you happen to be running my Pi Btc Weather Clock (https://github.com/jakeday/pi-btc-weather-clock), you can turn on the built in link!

### Installation

Considering this is a standalone web app, you can save it and open the index.html file directly in your browser! No installation required!

If you want to control this app from other devices on your network (tablets, phones, laptops, etc) without copying over the files, you'll have to have a web server running. My favorite way is to use a RaspberryPi. You can follow the guide here:
